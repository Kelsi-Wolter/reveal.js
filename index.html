						## Slide 1
						The problem
- Migrating data to a shiny new table with partitions and a better schema
- In the process of moving the previous functions to the new table, we ran into some latency issues
- One of the functions involved a lookup by tracking_number + location_id, this was behind an endpoint used to process cancellations
- Callers of the endpoint started to see timeouts
  - Upon further investigation, we saw that the processing time had significantly increased since switching over to the new table
  - Easy fix - add an index to the lookup to improve performance
  - In past, we added indexes using CONCURRENTLY to avoid downtime associated with table locking
  - Postgres does not support using concurrently on partitioned tables at this time
  - How to add an index to the partitioned parent table and child tables and all newly created child tables without locking anything and preventing table writes??
